<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spray Foam Insulations Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open-Cell Foam</li><li>Closed-Cell Foam</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The spray foam insulation market is divided into two main types: open-cell foam and closed-cell foam. Open-cell foam is lighter and more flexible, providing excellent sound absorption and thermal insulation, making it ideal for interior applications. Conversely, closed-cell foam is denser and more rigid, offering superior moisture resistance and structural support, suitable for exterior applications and areas prone to water exposure. Both types enhance energy efficiency, but their specific properties cater to different insulation needs.</p></p>
